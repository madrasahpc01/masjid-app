Our mosque holds regular Quran Grammar Classes for adults every Monday and Friday in Urdu, and every Wednesday in English. These sessions give learners an excellent opportunity to understand the language of the Qur’an, learn word meanings, and grasp the essential rules of Arabic grammar. Classes usually begin at 7 PM and run for one hour, but timings may vary depending on the prayer schedule. During winter, when Isha begins at 7 PM, the Quran Grammar Class starts immediately after Salah.
